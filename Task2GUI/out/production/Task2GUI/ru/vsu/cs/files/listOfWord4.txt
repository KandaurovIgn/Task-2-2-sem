True art blooms for a moment and forever. A dream can be a support of a source of suffering. A dream can fill a person with life or kill him. Even if a dream has left a person, a part of it will always smolder in the depths of his heart. Everyone should at least once imagine that their life is the life of God's martyr, pursuing his dream.
